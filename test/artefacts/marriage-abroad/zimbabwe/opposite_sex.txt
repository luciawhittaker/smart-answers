Check the [travel advice for Zimbabwe](/foreign-travel-advice/zimbabwe) and [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You should apply for a document showing that you’re free to marry from the General Register Office, National Records of Scotland or nidirect.

###Document showing that you’re free to marry

If you are from England or Wales, you can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. ‘No trace letters’ cost £50 for each 10 year period from age 16 or when you entered the UK. Specify how many years you need the search to cover and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a ‘no trace letter’ to be issued.

If you are from Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you are from Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry’ or a ‘marriage index search’ from [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

###If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll).

If you don’t provide evidence, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

##Get married

You’ll need to give your no trace letter to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be a:

- priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Zimbabwe
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You can’t register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for duplicates.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
