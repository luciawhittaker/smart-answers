Same-sex partnerships in Ecuador are known as ‘union de hecho’.

Contact the relevant local authorities in Ecuador to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked for an affirmation or affidavit document to prove that you’re allowed to enter into this partnership.

To swear an affirmation or affidavit, [make an appointment at the British Embassy Quito](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-quito/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker).

You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.
