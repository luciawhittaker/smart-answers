##Before you start

You can get married at the British Embassy in Seoul if you are marrying someone who is not a national of South Korea.

##Prove you’re free to get married

You need to give notice of your marriage at the embassy. Your partner will also need to give notice if they’re British.

You need to have been in South Korea for at least 7 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday, you can’t give notice until the following Tuesday.

You both need to sign a declaration that you’re free to marry.

###Give notice of your marriage

Make an appointment to give notice of your marriage [at the embassy in Seoul](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-seoul/consular-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker).

It costs £50 to give notice. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/south-korea-consular-fees) with cash or credit card, but not by personal cheque.

You need to bring your and your partner’s passports. Your passport must have an entry stamp showing that you’ve been in South Korea for at least 7 full days.

If your partner isn’t British, you’ll need to bring their ‘single certificate’. They can get this from their embassy or consulate.

If you or your partner have been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your [original decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

The embassy will display your notice publicly for 14 days. If nobody registers an objection, you can get married up to 3 months after the end of your notice period.

Contact the [embassy in Seoul](/world/organisations/british-embassy-seoul#contact-us) to set a date for your wedding.

###Sign a declaration

You and your partner need to sign a declaration to say that you’re legally allowed to get married. You’ll do this at the embassy in Seoul on your wedding day.

##Get married

Your wedding ceremony will be at the embassy in Seoul on the date you agreed.

You both need to bring your passports to show that you’ve been in South Korea for at least the last 21 full days.

You’ll need to bring 2 witnesses to your ceremony. Your witnesses must:

- bring photo ID
- be 16 or over
- know you or your partner
- understand English well enough to follow the ceremony and read the marriage register

You, your partner, your 2 witnesses and the consular officer will sign the marriage register.

It costs £150 to register your marriage. You can also pay £50 for a marriage certificate if you want one.

You’ll need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/south-korea-consular-fees) with cash or credit card before your wedding.

##After you get married

You’ll be married under UK law, so your marriage will be recognised in the UK but not in South Korea or other countries where same sex marriage isn’t legal.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
